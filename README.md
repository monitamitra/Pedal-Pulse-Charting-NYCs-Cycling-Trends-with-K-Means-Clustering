# Pedal Pulse: Charting NYC's Cycling Trends with K-Means Clustering
- **Solution Design:** Engineered a k-means clustering model with Python and scikit-learn to analyze NYC Citi Bike usage, focusing on geospatial and trip time trends.
- **Data Analysis:** Leveraged Pandas, Numpy, Scipy for data preprocessing, and applied Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing clusters and detailed bike usage patterns
- **Learning Curve:** Gained exposure to unsupervised ML, mastered k-means algorithm principles such as the elbow method
- **Further Impact:** Conducted analyses of bike ridership patterns, offering strategic suggestions to bolster urban planning and sustainability in NYC
